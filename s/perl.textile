h1. Perl

Perl's "DBI":http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI, available on the "CPAN":http://search.cpan.org, supports parameterized SQL calls.  Both the @do@ method and @prepare@ method support parameters ("placeholders", as they call them) for most database drivers. For example:

<codeblock>
$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?");
foreach my $email (@emails) {
    $sth->execute($email);
    $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref;
    [...]
}
</codeblock>

Explain Perl's taint mode and how DBI supports taint mode, both inbound and outbound.
