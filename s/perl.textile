h1. Perl

Perl's DBI is actually reasonable in this regard: Both the @do@
method and @prepare@ method support parameters ("placeholders", as
they call them) for most DBD drivers. For example:

<pre style="code">
$row = $dbh->do('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', undef, $email);
</pre>

Or:

<pre style="code">
$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?");
foreach my $email (@emails) {
    $row = $sth->execute($email);
    [...]
}
</pre>
