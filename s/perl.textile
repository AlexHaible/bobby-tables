Perl's "DBI":http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI, available on the "CPAN":http://search.cpan.org, supports parameterized SQL calls.  Both the @do@ method and @prepare@ method support parameters ("placeholders", as they call them) for most database drivers. For example:

<pre style="code">
$row = $dbh->do('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', undef, $email);
</pre>

Or:

<pre style="code">
$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?");
foreach my $email (@emails) {
    $row = $sth->execute($email);
    [...]
}
</pre>
