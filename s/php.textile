PHP is a little more disorganized. The standard MySQL extension
doesn't support parameterization, although the PostgreSQL one does:

<pre style="code">
$result = pg_query_params( $dbh, 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1', array($email) );
</pre>

(Unfortunately, the query really needs to be in single-quotes or
have the @$@ escaped to avoid PHP trying to parse it as a variable.)

That said, PHP's ODBC and PDO extensions both support parameterization
and multiple databases:

<pre style="code">
$stmt = odbc_prepare( $conn, 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?' );
$success = odbc_execute( $stmt, array($email) );
</pre>

Or:

<pre style="code">
$res = odbc_exec($conn, 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', array($email));

$sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email');
$sth->execute(array(':email' => $email));
</pre>
